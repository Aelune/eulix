# Eulix_Embed


## What is Eulix_Embed?

Eulix Embed converts parsed code (from `eulix-parser`) into semantic chunks optimized for:
- **LLM Context**: Send relevant code to Claude, GPT, or local models
- **Vector Search**: Fast similarity search across your codebase
- **RAG Systems**: Build retrieval-augmented generation pipelines
- **Code Q&A**: Answer questions about your code semantically

##  Key Features

- **GPU Acceleration**: Auto-detects NVIDIA (CUDA) or AMD (ROCm) GPUs for 10x speedup
- **100% Local**: No API calls, no cloud dependencies, zero costs
- **Offline-First**: Download models once, use forever
- **Smart Chunking**: Functions, classes, files, with auto-tagging


### this bin was mostly(85%) build using claude due my lack of expertese in this matter
